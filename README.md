## Project Overview

This challenge involves a comprehensive workflow: fetching financial data, performing exploratory data analysis, building and comparing statistical and deep learning forecasting models, optimizing a three-asset portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), and validating the strategy through backtesting.

This project recognizes the **Efficient Market Hypothesis**, which suggests that precise stock price prediction is highly challenging. Therefore, our models will serve as a critical component within a broader decision-making framework, focusing on forecasting trends and volatility rather than exact prices.

## üó∫Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide

### Task 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration

**Objective**: Load, clean, and analyze the data to uncover initial insights.

1.  **Fetch Data**: Use the `yfinance` library to download historical data for `TSLA`, `BND`, and `SPY` for the specified date range.
2.  **Data Cleaning**:
    * Check the basic statistics (`.describe()`) of the datasets.
    * Verify data types and handle any missing values through interpolation or filling.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    * Visualize the closing prices over time for each asset.
    * Calculate and plot the daily percentage change (daily returns) to observe volatility.
    * Plot rolling means and standard deviations to analyze short-term trends.
4.  **Stationarity Test**:
    * Perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the closing prices and daily returns to check for stationarity.
    * Discuss the results. Non-stationary series will require differencing for ARIMA models.
5.  **Risk Metrics**:
    * Calculate foundational metrics such as **Value at Risk (VaR)** and the **Sharpe Ratio** to assess historical risk and return.

### Task 2: Develop Time Series Forecasting Models

**Objective**: Build, compare, and evaluate at least two different forecasting models to predict TSLA's stock price.

1.  **Data Splitting**:
    * Split the data chronologically into training and testing sets. **Do not shuffle the data.**
    * Example Split: Train on data from 2015-2023 and test on 2024-2025.
2.  **Model 1: ARIMA/SARIMA (Statistical Model)**:
    * Use `pmdarima.auto_arima` to automatically find the optimal `(p, d, q)` parameters for the model.
    * Train the ARIMA model on the training dataset.
3.  **Model 2: LSTM (Deep Learning Model)**:
    * **Scale the data** (e.g., using `MinMaxScaler`) as neural networks are sensitive to the scale of input data.
    * Create sequences of data (e.g., use the last 60 days to predict the next day).
    * Build, compile, and train the LSTM model. Experiment with different architectures (layers, neurons) and hyperparameters (epochs, batch size).
4.  **Model Evaluation**:
    * Generate forecasts from both models on the test set.
    * Compare their performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.
    * Discuss which model performed better and why.

### Task 3: Forecast Future Market Trends

**Objective**: Use your best-performing model from Task 2 to generate a 6-12 month forecast for `TSLA`.

1.  **Generate Forecast**: Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
2.  **Visualize Forecast**: Plot the historical data alongside the forecasted prices. Include **confidence intervals** to represent the uncertainty in the prediction.
3.  **Interpret Results**:
    * **Trend Analysis**: Identify the overall forecasted trend (upward, downward, or stable).
    * **Risk Analysis**: Discuss the width of the confidence intervals. Wider intervals imply greater uncertainty, especially for long-term forecasts.
    * **Opportunities & Risks**: Based on the forecast, outline potential market opportunities and risks for TSLA.

### Task 4: Optimize Portfolio Based on Forecast

**Objective**: Construct an optimal portfolio using the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).

1.  **Define Expected Returns**:
    * For **TSLA**, use the return forecast from your best model.
    * For **BND** and **SPY**, use their historical average daily returns (annualized).
2.  **Calculate Covariance Matrix**: Compute the historical covariance matrix for all three assets to understand how they move in relation to each other.
3.  **Generate Efficient Frontier**:
    * Using the expected returns and the covariance matrix, run an optimization to generate the Efficient Frontier with a library like `PyPortfolioOpt`.
    * Plot the frontier with risk (volatility) on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.
4.  **Identify Key Portfolios**:
    * On the plot, mark the **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio** and the **Minimum Volatility Portfolio**.
5.  **Recommend a Portfolio**:
    * Select an optimal portfolio and justify your choice based on risk-return objectives.
    * Summarize the final recommended weights for TSLA, BND, and SPY, along with the portfolio's expected annual return, volatility, and Sharpe Ratio.

### Task 5: Strategy Backtesting

**Objective**: Validate your proposed portfolio strategy by simulating its performance on historical data and comparing it against a benchmark.

1.  **Define Backtesting Period**: Use the last year of your data (e.g., August 1, 2024 - July 31, 2025).
2.  **Define Benchmark**: Use a static **60% SPY / 40% BND** portfolio as a simple benchmark.
3.  **Simulate Strategy**:
    * Start with the optimal weights determined in Task 4.
    * Simulate holding this portfolio over the backtesting period. For simplicity, you can hold the initial weights for the full year without rebalancing.
4.  **Analyze Performance**:
    * Plot the cumulative returns of your strategy against the benchmark.
    * Calculate the final total return and Sharpe Ratio for both portfolios.
    * Conclude with a summary of whether your strategy outperformed the benchmark and what this suggests about its viability.
